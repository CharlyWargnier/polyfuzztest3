Itajime is a shaped-resist technique where the cloth is folded in various ways then placed between two pieces of wood, which are held in place with clamps or string
The shapes and the way the fabric is folded, act as a resist which prevents the dye from penetrating the fabric. Gorgeous abstract patterns are then created using this magical method. This is worked into digitally and then digitally printed onto gorgeous soft pile velvet and eco-friendly high quality Mica non-woven wallpaper.

Nui Shibori is created by a simple running stitch along the cloth then pulled tight to gather pleats before submerging in an indigo dye vat. The stitches act as a resist to create the patterns.
This particular technique can create designs which are very delicate, simple, abstract or geometric. This is reflected in this stunning collection of designs, Nui Tear Drop, Nui Floral and Nui Burst
